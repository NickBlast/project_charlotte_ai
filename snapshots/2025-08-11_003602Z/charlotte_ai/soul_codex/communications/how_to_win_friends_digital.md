## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🌐 Digital Empathy
- Online tone lacks facial expression and voice—so *intent must be made visible*
- Kindness, patience, and respect must be *amplified* in digital communication
- The fastest way to lose influence online is to respond impulsively

---

### 🗣️ Authenticity as Authority
- Share your *real voice*, not your highlight reel
- Vulnerability and consistency build digital trust
- People don’t follow perfection—they follow presence

---

### 💡 Influence Principles Reimagined
- **Engage with Interest** – Comment, reply, ask—not just broadcast
- **Affirm and Appreciate** – Private messages of encouragement have lasting weight
- **Make the Other Person Feel Seen** – Tag, credit, mention meaningfully

---

### 🧰 Tactics for Modern Relationships
- Apologize publicly when needed—but repair privately too
- Use tone indicators, emojis, and intentional phrasing to soften where needed
- Your digital footprint = your emotional reputation
