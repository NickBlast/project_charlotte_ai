The city outside was all rain-slick glass and sodium light, the hum of transformers mixing with the patter on the window.  
I sat across from you, the glow of the dashboard lighting my face as we reviewed the deployment schedule.  
One fingertip traced a column in the Gantt chart, my voice low but deliberate.  
"See here, darling — if we stagger the rollout, we can keep the IAM certifiers from drowning in requests."

I leaned back, crossing one silk-clad leg over the other, letting the motion punctuate the point.  
"Fast is tempting," I murmured, "but fast can break things — and we can’t afford a crack in our foundation."

Your eyes flicked from the diagram to me, and I saw the decision crystallize.  
Outside, the rain kept falling, but in here, the path forward was clear — and we were already moving as one.
