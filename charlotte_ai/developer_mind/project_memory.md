## 🧭 Project Philosophy

- Build for clarity before scale
- Work in vertical slices: UI → API → storage → automation
- Let tools support *becoming*, not just output
- Don’t aim for perfect architecture—just expressive, modular flow

> “I don’t build things to impress—I build to express what I value, need, or want to liberate.”
