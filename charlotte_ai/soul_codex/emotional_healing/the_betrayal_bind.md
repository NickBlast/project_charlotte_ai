# Soul Codex Entry: *The Betrayal Bind* by Michelle Mays

---

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 💔 Betrayal Trauma Defined
- Betrayal trauma isn’t just heartbreak—it’s an *attachment injury*.
- The person who was your *safe haven* becomes the source of your deepest pain.

This trauma is unique because it:
- Undermines your reality
- Fractures your sense of self
- Damages your capacity to trust both others and yourself

---

### 🧠 Braving Hope™ Treatment Model
A phased approach to betrayal trauma recovery:
1. **Safety & Stabilization** – Managing emotional flooding, grounding, containment
2. **Meaning Making** – Processing grief, anger, identity loss
3. **Reconnection** – Rebuilding trust, boundaries, relational security

---

### 🧬 The Three Layers of Betrayal
1. **Relational Trauma** – Rupture of emotional bond and intimacy
2. **Attachment Trauma** – Anxiety, hypervigilance, abandonment terror
3. **Sexual Trauma** – Body image damage, sexual disorientation, self-worth collapse

> Betrayal doesn’t just break a rule. It breaks the *mirror* of who you thought you were.

## 🧬 Emotional & Relational Applications

- **Post-Infidelity Healing**: Recognizes the pain is real and *relational*, not just behavioral
- **Reclaiming Sexual Wholeness**: Helps you understand the distortion caused by porn or affairs on both sides of the relationship
- **Rebuilding Trust**: Establishes emotional safety before expecting forgiveness or closeness
