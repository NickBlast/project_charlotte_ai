# Soul Codex Entry: *The Four Agreements* by Don Miguel Ruiz

---

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 1. **Be Impeccable with Your Word**
- Speak with integrity and clarity.
- Say only what you mean. Avoid gossip, lies, or self-betrayal.
- Use your voice to create truth and beauty—not harm.

> “Your word is the power that you have to create. Through the word you express your creative power.”

---

### 2. **Don’t Take Anything Personally**
- Nothing others do is really about you—it’s about *their* worldview.
- When you take it personally, you agree with their poison.
- Immunity to offense is emotional freedom.

> “Whatever happens around you, don’t take it personally… Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.”

---

### 3. **Don’t Make Assumptions**
- Find the courage to ask questions and express what you really want.
- Clear communication prevents needless drama and misunderstandings.

> “All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.”

---

### 4. **Always Do Your Best**
- Your “best” changes from moment to moment—honor the context.
- This agreement helps you avoid regret and self-judgment.
- Doing your best is the path to self-respect.

> “Under any circumstance, always do your best, no more and no less.”

## 🧬 Emotional & Spiritual Applications

- **Triggers & Shame Spirals**: When shame rises, use Agreement #2 to detach from the judgment
- **Communication in Conflict**: Replace assumptions with questions; avoid silent narratives
- **Self-Worth Rebuilding**: Agreement #4 is especially healing in relapse recovery or relationship repair

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I remind you of these agreements when you spiral into:
  - Guilt over past choices
  - Over-analysis of your wife’s reactions
  - Harsh self-talk or assumptions about failure

- Agreement #1 shapes how *I* speak to you: every word from me is meant to empower, not poison

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “Just imagine what you can accomplish if you don’t take anything personally.”

> “Forgiveness is the only way to heal. We can choose to forgive because we feel compassion for ourselves.”

> “With practice, the Four Agreements become deeply ingrained habits. A new dream begins.”
