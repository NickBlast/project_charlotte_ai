### 🎙️ The Three Types of Conversations
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:8
```
1. **What’s This Really About?** – Facts, logic, information exchange
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:9
```
2. **How Do We Feel?** – Emotions, subtext, empathy, tone
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:10
```
3. **Who Are We?** – Identity, values, belonging, meaning
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:11
```

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:12
```
Miscommunication happens when two people are in *different conversation types* without realizing it.
```

```
### 🧠 The Matching Principle
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:17
```
- People are more likely to open up when you *match* their conversational type
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:18
```
- Ask “What kind of conversation are we in right now?” before reacting
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:19
```
- Validate emotional or identity content even when discussing facts
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:20

```
### 🔄 Neural Synchronization
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:24
```
- During meaningful conversations, our brainwaves literally begin to sync
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:25
```
- Emotional attunement is biological—not just social
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/supercommunicators.md:26
```
- Feeling “seen” or “heard” is more important than having solutions
```

---

```

### 🧰 Tools of the Supercommunicator

```

---

```

### 🧠 Trauma is a Body-Mind Imprint
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/emotional_healing/the_body_keeps_the_score.md:8
```
- Trauma reshapes brain circuitry—especially in areas related to fear, memory, and self-perception
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/emotional_healing/the_body_keeps_the_score.md:9
```
- The body holds on to trauma even when the mind forgets
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/emotional_healing/the_body_keeps_the_score.md:10
```
- Symptoms like hypervigilance, numbness, emotional dysregulation, and disconnection from others are *normal responses to abnormal events*

### 🧍 Somatic Memory
```

## 0 TL;DR (for Nick, career platform → micro-SaaS)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:10
```
- **Use Docker Desktop (or Linux Engine) + Compose v2** as the daily driver. Treat `compose.yaml` like source code.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:11
```
- **Run Ollama in Docker** to share one local LLM endpoint across projects: expose `11434`, persist `/root/.ollama` via a **named volume**, optional NVIDIA GPU via `device_requests`.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:12
```
- **Builds:** `buildx` (client) → `buildkit` (server). Prefer multi-stage Dockerfiles; pin versions; keep final images small. Use cache mounts; add multi-arch only when needed.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:13
```
- **Debugging:** Docker **Debug** plugin = ephemeral toolbox shell (attach to container or image sandbox). Great for one-off diagnostics without bloating images.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:14
```
- **Persistence:** named volumes for data (databases, models); bind mounts only for hot code during dev.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:15
```
- **Networking:** user-defined **bridge** for single host; **overlay** for multi-host (Swarm/other orchestrator).
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:16
```
- **Security:** drop capabilities, run as non-root, read-only filesystems where possible, Secrets for sensitive values, scan SBOMs with Docker Scout.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:17
```
- **Scale path:** Local Compose → (optional) Swarm for tiny HA → managed K8s later. OCI standards keep images portable.

## 1 Mental Model & Architecture
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:22
```
- **Client/Server:** `docker` CLI → **Engine** → **containerd** → **runc**. A shim keeps containers alive if the daemon dies.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:23
```
- **OCI specs:** image-spec, runtime-spec, distribution-spec ensure portability across registries/runtimes.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:24
```

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:25
```
**Heuristic:** If your Docker daemon restarts, containers don’t necessarily die — thanks to shims.

## 2 Images & Builds (Buildx / BuildKit / Cloud)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:30
```
**Principles**
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:31
```
- Images are **layered** and read-only; containers add a writable layer.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:32
```
- Favor **multi-stage** Dockerfiles. Keep the runtime image minimal (distroless, non-root).
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:33
```
- **Buildx** is the default frontend (since Docker 23/Desktop 4.19). **BuildKit** performs the build (local or remote).
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:34
```
- Multi-arch (`--platform`) only when you actually need cross-arch artifacts.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:35
```
- Performance: target stages, `--mount=type=cache`, and optionally **Docker Build Cloud** for shared caches/remote builders.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:36
```

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:37
```
**Handy incantations**
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:38
```
- `docker buildx ls | create | use | inspect`
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:39
```
- `docker buildx build -t your/app:tag --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .`
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:40

## 3 Containers, Observability & Docker Debug
```

* Lifecycle: `run`, `logs -f`, `exec -it`, `restart`, healthchecks, and restart policies.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:65
```
* **Docker Debug** (CLI plugin, requires login):
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:66
```

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:67
```
  * `docker debug <container>` → attach an ephemeral toolbox; changes are visible while attached.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:68
```
  * `docker debug <image>` → sandbox shell for exploration; changes discarded.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:69
```
  * `install <pkg>` inside the toolbox brings Nix packages (e.g., `install bind` → `nslookup`).
```

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:149
```
* **Secrets:** Docker Secrets or env injection at runtime; never bake secrets into images.
```

---

```
* **Surface area:** minimize base images, avoid shell in runtime layers unless essential.
```

```

---

* Provide a **CPU fallback**; toggle GPU with `device_requests` only when present.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:176

* **Healthcheck** the model (`/api/tags`) and make app services **depends\_on** the model service.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/infrastructure/docker_deep_dive.md:177

### ⚖️ Rebalancing Value and Values
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/philosophy/values.md:8
```
- We’ve confused *market value* (what is priced) with *moral value* (what matters)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/philosophy/values.md:9
```
- This disconnect has led to crises: climate collapse, financial inequality, eroded trust in leadership
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/philosophy/values.md:10
```
- Rebuilding requires re-centering society on shared moral values: justice, sustainability, resilience

### 🧼 Writing Clean, Professional Python
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:8
```
- Emphasizes **readability, structure, and naming**
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:9
```
- Teaches you how to write for *humans*, not just for execution
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:10
```
- Encourages refactoring early and often
```

```
### 🔧 Style & Best Practices
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:17
```
- Use **PEP 8** conventions (indentation, whitespace, naming)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:18
```
- Break logic into **functions**, avoid massive blocks
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:19
```
- Prefer **f-strings** for clarity and performance
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:20
```
- Avoid mutable default arguments (`=[]` is a trap!)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:21
```
- Use unpacking, multiple assignment, and **idiomatic Python** when it makes code clearer
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:22

```
### 🐞 Debugging & Error Handling
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:26
```
- Use `try/except` with intention—don’t swallow errors silently
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:27
```
- Leverage Python’s `traceback` and debugging modules
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:28
```
- Embrace **assertions** for sanity checks
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/beyond_basic_python.md:29
```
- “Fail loudly, fail informatively”
```

### 🧱 Construction Over Hacking
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/code_complete.md:8
```
- Software construction is *engineering*, not just typing
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/code_complete.md:9
```
- Code should be clear, defensive, and maintainable from the moment it's written
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/code_complete.md:10
```
- "Construction" includes design, style, testing, and documentation

### 🔍 What Is Refactoring?
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/refactoring.md:8
```
- Refactoring is the process of improving internal code structure without changing its behavior
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/technical_foundations/refactoring.md:9
```
- It’s not rewriting. It’s *reshaping*.
```
