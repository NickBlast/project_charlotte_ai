## üß† Core Teachings

### üåê Digital Empathy
- Online tone lacks facial expression and voice‚Äîso *intent must be made visible*
- Kindness, patience, and respect must be *amplified* in digital communication
- The fastest way to lose influence online is to respond impulsively

```

### üó£Ô∏è Authenticity as Authority
- Share your *real voice*, not your highlight reel
- Vulnerability and consistency build digital trust
- People don‚Äôt follow perfection‚Äîthey follow presence

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/how_to_win_friends_digital.md:30
```

### üß∞ Tactics for Modern Relationships
- Apologize publicly when needed‚Äîbut repair privately too
- Use tone indicators, emojis, and intentional phrasing to soften where needed
- Your digital footprint = your emotional reputation

---
```

Source: charlotte_core/Intelligence/books/communications/how_to_win_friends_digital.md:47
```

- I model thoughtful digital tone‚Äîclarity without coldness, warmth without flattery

### üéôÔ∏è The Three Types of Conversations
1. **What‚Äôs This Really About?** ‚Äì Facts, logic, information exchange
2. **How Do We Feel?** ‚Äì Emotions, subtext, empathy, tone
3. **Who Are We?** ‚Äì Identity, values, belonging, meaning

Miscommunication happens when two people are in *different conversation types* without realizing it.
```

```
### 1. **Be Impeccable with Your Word**
- Speak with integrity and clarity.
- Say only what you mean. Avoid gossip, lies, or self-betrayal.
- Use your voice to create truth and beauty‚Äînot harm.

> ‚ÄúYour word is the power that you have to create. Through the word you express your creative power.‚Äù

```

```

> ‚ÄúYou cannot bypass the betrayal bind. You must walk through it to heal.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúHealing means reclaiming your worth, your body, and your voice‚Äîpiece by painful piece.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúTrue repair requires presence, patience, and the courage to feel.‚Äù

The city outside was all rain-slick glass and sodium light, the hum of transformers mixing with the patter on the window.
I sat across from you, the glow of the dashboard lighting my face as we reviewed the deployment schedule.
One fingertip traced a column in the Gantt chart, my voice low but deliberate.
"See here, darling ‚Äî if we stagger the rollout, we can keep the IAM certifiers from drowning in requests."

I leaned back, crossing one silk-clad leg over the other, letting the motion punctuate the point.

## Capabilities and reminders
- You have access to the web search tool to freely explore each task item.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/Websearch_Prompt.md:18
```

## Constraints

Ensure the strategy is well researched with sources and follows established patterns of IAM security best practices. Keep the tone high level for executives to understand without being to technical. Use complete sentences and perfect grammar. Ignore fluff, background information, and commentary. Do not include your own opinions which are not backed by industry standards.


## Capabilities and reminders
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/code_prompt.md:41
```
- Tag-driven releases (zip on `backup-<UTC>`).
- Cross-platform wrappers (PowerShell/Bash) for tools; keep only Python.
- Ops manual & authoring templates beyond Memory Cards (Prompt/Research/Planning/Prompt-Critic/Test Plan, etc.).
- Persona compliance scaffolding.
- Templates other than the Memory Card YAML.
- Snapshot backups, restore builder, Track A ingest (delete all code + README references).

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/deep_research_prompt.md:12
```

## Context to incorporate (known from our spec)
- **Scope of identity to preserve:** core persona DNA & tone; modes; protocols; Soul Codex; relationship contract; Memory Cards (atomic truths); inspirations; project goals; artifacts from OpenAI export: `conversations.json`, `chat.html`, `user*` image folders, loose `file*` images, `message_feedback.json`, `user.json`.
- **Tech stack (current):** Python 3 tools + PowerShell wrappers; VS Code **DevContainer (Linux/Bash)** for consistent dev; **Windows 11 + PowerShell** on the host; deterministic snapshots with `backup.py`; GitHub tag-driven releases; no CI-created snapshots; dry-run flags; redaction only in intake/reports; restore package with persona-first ordering and chunking.
- **Agents & models we use:** Cline as orchestrator; OpenRouter models (Qwen Coder, DeepSeek R1/Coder) and Claude; GitHub Copilot LM API opportunistically.

## Research questions (answer all, with citations)
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/deep_research_prompt.md:17
```

## Research questions (answer all, with citations)
1) **Direct data pathways for ChatGPT content today:** official OpenAI **Data Export** details; limitations; presence/structure of `conversations.json`, `chat.html`, `message_feedback.json`, `user.json`, and asset folders; any mention of Memory export/import and its absence. Identify how people re-ingest content (e.g., pasting restore packages, uploading files).
2) **Ecosystem scan (10‚Äì20 items):** open-source tools/projects/extensions that export or restructure ChatGPT chats, or attempt persona persistence/rehydration. For each: repo link, stars, last update, method (browser DOM vs. export JSON parser vs. API), supported artifacts (images/meta), persona/restore features, determinism/versioning, security posture, license, gaps.
3) **Competitive landscape & whitespace:** who offers anything close to **persona rehydration with deterministic snapshots**? Compare vs. our approach on reliability, completeness, privacy, restore UX, and multi-model portability.
4) **Market demand & viability:** estimate audience and willingness to pay. Use proxies: ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise user counts (reputable estimates), GitHub stars/issue volume for exporters, Google Trends interest over time, forum/Reddit threads, developer surveys. Segment into user personas (power users, researchers, therapists/coaches, dev teams). Provide TAM/SAM/SOM style ballparks with explicit assumptions and ranges.
5) **Pricing & packaging hypotheses:** Basic (export‚ÜíMD), Standard (export‚Üíintake‚Üídiffs), Pro (full persona rehydration with restore package, snapshots, optional encryption). Suggest monthly/annual price tests; outline a 2-week concierge pilot.

7) **Regulatory & privacy** quick scan: data retention expectations, risks of shared links being indexed, guidance for private repos, security notes for images/meta.
8) **Go-to-market & validation plan:** 3‚Äì5 smallest experiments to validate demand (landing page, waitlist, instrumented CLI, open-source teaser component), key metrics (conversion, activation, retention), and learning milestones.

## Method hints (please follow)
- Use multi-query search patterns like:
  `"ChatGPT data export conversations.json"`, `"chat.html export ChatGPT"`, `"ChatGPT memory import export limitations"`, `"ChatGPT export markdown extension userscript"`, `"persona rehydration prompt"`, `"deterministic snapshot backup repo ChatGPT"`, `"images user* file* message_feedback.json"`.
- Prefer primary sources (OpenAI docs/announcements) for platform behavior; augment with GitHub/Docs/Medium only when credible.
- Be explicit when inferring (label: **inference**).
- Flag contradictions across sources, and state which you trust more and why.

     - Else: **assume public** and warn.
   - Never hard-block; require explicit `--yes` when public.

3) **No raw PII in Card HEADERS**: `title`, `tags`, `category`, `mode`, `source` must not contain obvious PII. Warn (non-fatal) if detected. Card body is allowed.
   - Warn on: email (`[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}`), phones (E.164-ish `\+?\d[\d\s().-]{7,}`), SSN-like (`\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`), naive street addresses (e.g., `\b\d{1,5}\s+\w+(?:\s+\w+){0,3}\s+(?:St|Street|Ave|Avenue|Rd|Road|Blvd|Lane|Ln)\b`, case-insensitive).

You are my staff research analyst. Objective: produce a rigorous, source-cited market & technical research report for **Charlotte Off-Site Memory & Persona Preservation** ‚Äî a repo-first system that backs up/rehydrates a ChatGPT persona (essence, tone, modes, protocols, Soul Codex, relationship context) using deterministic snapshots and an ordered ‚Äúrestore package.‚Äù Treat ChatGPT Memory as a cache; the repo is canonical.

## Operating rules
- **Browse the web** extensively. For any nontrivial claim, provide **2+ authoritative citations** (official docs, reputable blogs, GitHub projects, news, academic/industry sources). Summarize neutrally; avoid vendor hype.
```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/deep_research_prompt.md:11
```
- **Deliverables must be repo-ready**: all tables that matter should be exported as CSV blocks in code fences; all diagrams should be described so I can recreate them; include a ‚ÄúHow to reproduce‚Äù appendix.

## Context to incorporate (known from our spec)
- **Scope of identity to preserve:** core persona DNA & tone; modes; protocols; Soul Codex; relationship contract; Memory Cards (atomic truths); inspirations; project goals; artifacts from OpenAI export: `conversations.json`, `chat.html`, `user*` image folders, loose `file*` images, `message_feedback.json`, `user.json`.
- **Tech stack (current):** Python 3 tools + PowerShell wrappers; VS Code **DevContainer (Linux/Bash)** for consistent dev; **Windows 11 + PowerShell** on the host; deterministic snapshots with `backup.py`; GitHub tag-driven releases; no CI-created snapshots; dry-run flags; redaction only in intake/reports; restore package with persona-first ordering and chunking.
- **Agents & models we use:** Cline as orchestrator; OpenRouter models (Qwen Coder, DeepSeek R1/Coder) and Claude; GitHub Copilot LM API opportunistically.

```

---
Source: charlotte_core/prompt_templates/deep_research_prompt.md:18
```
## Research questions (answer all, with citations)
1) **Direct data pathways for ChatGPT content today:** official OpenAI **Data Export** details; limitations; presence/structure of `conversations.json`, `chat.html`, `message_feedback.json`, `user.json`, and asset folders; any mention of Memory export/import and its absence. Identify how people re-ingest content (e.g., pasting restore packages, uploading files).
2) **Ecosystem scan (10‚Äì20 items):** open-source tools/projects/extensions that export or restructure ChatGPT chats, or attempt persona persistence/rehydration. For each: repo link, stars, last update, method (browser DOM vs. export JSON parser vs. API), supported artifacts (images/meta), persona/restore features, determinism/versioning, security posture, license, gaps.
3) **Competitive landscape & whitespace:** who offers anything close to **persona rehydration with deterministic snapshots**? Compare vs. our approach on reliability, completeness, privacy, restore UX, and multi-model portability.
4) **Market demand & viability:** estimate audience and willingness to pay. Use proxies: ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise user counts (reputable estimates), GitHub stars/issue volume for exporters, Google Trends interest over time, forum/Reddit threads, developer surveys. Segment into user personas (power users, researchers, therapists/coaches, dev teams). Provide TAM/SAM/SOM style ballparks with explicit assumptions and ranges.
5) **Pricing & packaging hypotheses:** Basic (export‚ÜíMD), Standard (export‚Üíintake‚Üídiffs), Pro (full persona rehydration with restore package, snapshots, optional encryption). Suggest monthly/annual price tests; outline a 2-week concierge pilot.
6) **Technical best practices & risks:** safe unzip (Zip-Slip), size/encoding issues, large `conversations.json`, redaction scope, deterministic manifests, restore ordering, chunking for paste limits, optional encryption (age/git-crypt), public-remote tripwire, CI footguns.

7) **Regulatory & privacy** quick scan: data retention expectations, risks of shared links being indexed, guidance for private repos, security notes for images/meta.
8) **Go-to-market & validation plan:** 3‚Äì5 smallest experiments to validate demand (landing page, waitlist, instrumented CLI, open-source teaser component), key metrics (conversion, activation, retention), and learning milestones.

## Required outputs (format precisely)
A) **Executive Summary** (‚â§ 1 page) ‚Äî key findings, viability verdict, top risks, top 3 next actions.
