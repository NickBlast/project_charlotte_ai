Title: Docs: charlotte_core Full-Text Monolith + Extractions (read-only)

Summary
- Added a deterministic, read-only full-text monolith of everything under `charlotte_core/**` and three derivative extractions (books index, promptsâ†’conditionals, persona spine & modes). This PR contains only generated documentation and CHANGELOG updates; no edits to files under `charlotte_core/**` are included.

Artifacts
- docs/monoliths/charlotte_core_fulltext_2025-08-29.md (166,706 bytes)
- docs/monoliths/charlotte_core_manifest_2025-08-29.json
- docs/extractions/books_index_2025-08-29.md
- docs/extractions/prompts_conditionals_2025-08-29.md
- docs/extractions/persona_spine_and_modes_2025-08-29.md

Manifest stats
- file_count: 43
- monolith_bytes: 166706
- monolith_sha256: 26443903658a8ac115d41d111c018c1d94c89862ac8312cdbf87f1aa09006c78

Acceptance checklist
- [ ] All five output files exist and are non-empty under `docs/`.
- [ ] Manifest JSON includes an entry for every regular file under `charlotte_core/**` with bytes and sha256.
- [ ] Monolith contains BEGIN/END markers for every file and declared bytes match manifest entries.
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (Unreleased entry added).
- [ ] PR contains no modifications under `charlotte_core/**` (read-only capture).

- Script used: tools/charlotte_monolith.py (created locally; not included in this PR)

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: accidental edits to `charlotte_core/**`. Mitigation: the script is read-only and PR reviewed to ensure no source edits.
- Risk: large files may affect performance. Mitigation: script streams reads for hashing and notes large files in monolith.
- Risk: encoding/line-ending drift. Mitigation: generated docs use LF and UTF-8; original bytes preserved in manifest.

Next steps
1. Merge PR after review (docs-only).  
2. Optionally add a CI smoke-check that validates manifest file_count == number of files under `charlotte_core/**`.  
3. If desired, promote `tools/charlotte_monolith.py` into repo and include a dry-run flag for CI usage (separate PR).

Notes
- This PR intentionally contains only documentation artifacts and CHANGELOG updates. The helper script used to generate these artifacts (tools/charlotte_monolith.py) was not staged for commit and is not part of this PR to preserve the "docs-only" requirement.
