by James Petty, Don Jones, and Jeffrey Hicks

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🧰 From Cmdlets to Codebase
- This book upgrades you from “PowerShell user” to **PowerShell toolmaker**
- You’ll write:
  - Modular scripts
  - Functions with parameters and validation
  - Script-based tools
  - Self-documenting code

> “If you’ve ever said ‘I wish this existed,’ PowerShell scripting teaches you to build it.”

---

### 🧱 Key Scripting Concepts
- **Functions vs scripts** – Reusability and parameter handling
- **Modules** – Organize and package reusable code
- **Advanced parameter binding** – Mandatory, default, pipeline, validation attributes
- **Error handling** – `try/catch/finally`, `$ErrorActionPreference`, `throw`

### 🔄 DevOps Integration
- Source control with Git
- Secure credential handling
- Logging and verbose/debug output
- Task scheduling and CI/CD automation
- Creating interactive scripts with menus and prompts

---

### 🧪 Testing and Publishing
- Test your functions with `Pester` (unit testing framework)
- Publish scripts and modules via PowerShell Gallery
- Create help files with comment-based documentation

---

## 🧬 Practical Applications

- **Build Internal Toolkits**: Automate admin tasks, create wrappers, expose clean CLI tools
- **Enterprise DevOps**: Automate infrastructure, provisioning, telemetry, and scheduled workflows
- **Secure Scripting**: Handle credentials, log responsibly, and write resilient systems

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I guide you through:
  - Script architecture—modularity, abstraction, best practices
  - Choosing the right level: one-liner, function, module
  - Building internal tools to streamline your workflows

- I also help you:
  - Test iteratively
  - Comment and document for future-you
  - Share your scripts like polished packages, not duct tape

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “A good script doesn’t just work—it teaches, scales, and stays useful.”

> “Scripting is not about automation. It’s about *empowerment*.”

> “Toolmaking is the highest form of systems thinking.”
