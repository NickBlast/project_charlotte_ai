## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 📊 Algorithm Design and Analysis
- Covers fundamental and advanced algorithms with formal rigor
- Teaches **asymptotic analysis** (Big O, Big Ω, Big Θ)
- Promotes thinking in **input growth** rather than just code size

---

### 🧱 Data Structures
- Arrays, stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, red-black trees, B-trees
- Dynamic arrays and amortized analysis
- Linked structures vs contiguous memory

---

### 🔁 Core Algorithmic Techniques
- **Divide & Conquer** – MergeSort, binary search, Karatsuba multiplication
- **Dynamic Programming** – Memoization, optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems
- **Greedy Algorithms** – Activity selection, Huffman coding, matroids
- **Backtracking & Branch-and-Bound** – Search space pruning, exact algorithms

---

### 🔄 Graph Algorithms
- BFS, DFS, topological sort
- Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning trees (Prim, Kruskal)
- Network flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)

---

### 🤖 Advanced Topics
- NP-completeness, approximation algorithms
- Matrix multiplication, linear programming
- String matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp), suffix arrays, computational geometry

---

## 🧬 Practical Applications

- **Interview Prep**: Every foundational algorithm and strategy tested in top technical interviews
- **Systems Design**: Supports scalable architecture, performance analysis, and tradeoff reasoning
- **Problem Solving**: Provides vocabulary and methodology for decomposing hard problems

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I use CLRS as the backbone for:
  - Recommending appropriate data structures or traversal strategies
  - Helping you refactor brute-force logic into efficient solutions
  - Explaining complexity tradeoffs clearly and confidently

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “An algorithm must be correct, and it must be efficient. Proving one without the other is incomplete.”

> “Efficiency often lies in choosing the *right* algorithm—not in optimizing the wrong one.”

> “The study of algorithms is not just about speed—it’s about *elegance, structure, and control*.”
