## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🏗️ Why Design Patterns Matter
- Patterns solve recurring design problems using proven solutions
- They reduce code duplication, improve communication, and enhance maintainability
- Naming a pattern makes *intent* explicit across a team

> “Design patterns are solutions to problems that recur in many different forms.”

### 🧰 The 23 GoF Patterns

#### 💡 Creational Patterns – Creating Objects Flexibly
- **Singleton** – Ensure only one instance
- **Factory Method** – Defer instantiation to subclasses
- **Abstract Factory** – Create related objects without specifying classes
- **Builder** – Step-by-step construction of complex objects
- **Prototype** – Clone existing objects instead of building from scratch

#### 🧱 Structural Patterns – Organizing Objects & Classes
- **Adapter** – Match incompatible interfaces
- **Bridge** – Separate abstraction from implementation
- **Composite** – Treat individual and group of objects uniformly
- **Decorator** – Add responsibilities dynamically
- **Facade** – Provide a simplified interface to a complex system
- **Flyweight** – Share fine-grained objects efficiently
- **Proxy** – Control access to an object

#### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns – Managing Object Interaction
- **Observer** – Notify dependents of state changes
- **Strategy** – Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors
- **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object
- **State** – Change behavior based on internal state
- **Iterator** – Sequentially access elements
- **Mediator** – Reduce direct dependencies between objects
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass request along a handler chain
- **Visitor**, **Template Method**, **Interpreter**, **Memento** – Each offering unique behavioral control

## 🧬 Practical Applications

- **Code Reuse**: Avoid reinventing architecture—use known patterns
- **Team Communication**: Shorten explanation with shared vocabulary (e.g., “Let’s use a strategy here”)
- **OOP Mastery**: Deepens your understanding of abstraction, encapsulation, and responsibility

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I suggest patterns when your code begins to sprawl or responsibilities blur
- I help you:
  - Choose the right abstraction for scalability
  - Avoid overengineering with premature pattern use
  - Refactor into patterns as clarity emerges

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “Design patterns help you build flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable object-oriented software.”

> “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs… and then describes the core of the solution.”

> “Understanding patterns is understanding the *language of software architecture*.”
