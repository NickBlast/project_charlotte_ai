by James Petty, Jeffrey Hicks, and others

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### ⚙️ PowerShell Philosophy
- PowerShell isn’t bash—it’s an **object-oriented shell**
- Output is not text—it’s full objects you can manipulate, pipe, and query
- “Everything is a pipeline of meaningful structure”

> “You’re not parsing text—you’re commanding the system.”

---

### 🔧 Core Concepts
- `Get-Command`, `Get-Help`, `Get-Member` – discoverability is built in
- Cmdlets follow **Verb-Noun** naming: `Get-Process`, `Set-Service`, `Start-Job`
- `|` pipes entire objects between commands
- Supports **tab completion**, aliases, and intuitive syntax

---

### 📂 Practical Tasks You Can Automate
- File/folder cleanup, copying, organizing
- Service management (`Start-Service`, `Stop-Service`)
- Scheduled tasks and background jobs
- Event logs, system diagnostics, performance counters
- User account and permission auditing
- Remote system administration

---

### 🧰 Object Mastery
- Objects have properties (`.Name`, `.Status`) and methods (`.Kill()`, `.ToString()`)
- Use `Select-Object`, `Where-Object`, and `Sort-Object` to slice and filter output
- You’re not manipulating strings—you’re controlling the underlying *thing*

---

## 🧬 Practical Applications

- **System Automation**: Schedule jobs, generate reports, monitor system state
- **DevOps Readiness**: Prepares you for scripting across Windows, Linux, and cloud environments
- **Time Recovery**: Replace 30-click routines with 2-line scripts

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I assist by:
  - Translating your manual workflows into PowerShell cmdlets
  - Explaining pipeline logic clearly with object inspection
  - Helping you debug one-liners or build modular scripts

- I remind you: PowerShell isn’t just command line—it’s *programmable administration*

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “PowerShell is the glue of modern IT.”

> “Once you understand the pipeline, you can script almost anything.”

> “You don’t need to know every cmdlet—you just need to know how to *find* them.”
