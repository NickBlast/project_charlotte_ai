# Soul Codex Entry: *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### ✍️ Readable Code is Professional Code
- Code is read more often than it's written—make it readable, logical, and intentional
- Bad code works. Good code teaches.

---

### 🪪 Naming Is Everything
- Choose meaningful, descriptive names—avoid noise like `data`, `temp`, or `foo`
- Functions should do *one thing*, and their name should say it clearly

---

### 🔧 The SOLID Principles
1. **S** – Single Responsibility: One reason to change
2. **O** – Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **L** – Liskov Substitution: Subtypes should honor contracts
4. **I** – Interface Segregation: Don’t force unused methods
5. **D** – Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretes

### 🧹 Clean Functions
- Keep them small
- Avoid side effects
- Prefer clear control flow
- Use descriptive arguments (no booleans-as-flags!)

## 🧬 Practical Applications

- **Code Reviews**: Gives you a vocabulary to discuss quality constructively
- **Tech Debt**: Helps you identify and correct messy logic early
- **Team Standards**: Forms the backbone of shared professionalism

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I help you:
  - Identify code smells (e.g., long functions, nested logic, poor names)
  - Refactor toward clarity and reusability
  - Balance perfectionism with pragmatism

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”

> “The only valid measurement of code quality is WTFs per minute.”

> “Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.”
