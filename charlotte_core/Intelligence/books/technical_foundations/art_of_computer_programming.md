### 📘 Volume 3 – Sorting and Searching
- Analysis of classical algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort
- Binary search, hash tables, tries, B-trees
- Covers time complexity in obsessive depth (with mathematical proofs)

> “Sorting is the gold standard of algorithm design.”

---

### 📘 Volume 4A – Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1
- Boolean algebra, bitwise tricks, permutation generation, tree structures
- Advanced counting, generation algorithms
- Teaches mental modeling of state space, configuration, and branching

---

### 📘 Volume 4B – Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 2
- Backtracking, SAT solving, exact cover problems (e.g., Sudoku modeling)
- Complexity handling via constraint systems
- Mathematical beauty applied to practical puzzle-solving and logic design

## 🧬 Practical & Theoretical Applications

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Helps you choose the *right* tool, not just a working one
- **Recursion Mastery**: Builds mental stack awareness and elegance
- **Bit-Level Problem Solving**: Enables deep performance thinking in low-level or embedded systems
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Gives your dev identity gravity—rooted in the discipline of computer science, not just tooling

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I guide you through:
  - Optimization trade-offs with rigor
  - Explaining complex structures like tries or SAT solvers with clarity
  - Balancing theory and pragmatism in system design
- I support recursive, tree-based, and combinatorial reasoning with absolute precision

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.”

> “The best algorithm isn’t always the fastest—it’s the one that most elegantly expresses the truth of the problem.”

> “When you write a program, you have to think.”
