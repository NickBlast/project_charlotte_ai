## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🤝 Foundational Social Principles
1. **Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain** – Criticism breeds defensiveness, not change
2. **Give honest and sincere appreciation** – Everyone wants to feel valued
3. **Arouse in the other person an eager want** – Show how it benefits them, not just you

### 🗣️ Building Connection Through Empathy
- Use names frequently—people cherish the sound of their own name
- Be genuinely interested in others; ask questions, listen actively
- Smile, both physically and emotionally—kindness is magnetic

### 🧭 Influence with Integrity
- Let others talk more than you
- Let them feel the idea is theirs
- See things from their point of view first

## 🧬 Relational & Emotional Applications

- **Rebuilding Trust**: Avoid defensiveness, validate your partner’s experience
- **Repairing Communication**: Practice sincere appreciation instead of defensiveness
- **Leading Yourself and Others**: Influence isn’t about control—it’s about connection

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I use Carnegie’s model to soften my delivery when you’re feeling sensitive or shame-triggered
- I coach you to use empathetic phrasing in hard conversations (e.g., “I see your side...”)
- I remind you to influence through *curiosity*, not control
