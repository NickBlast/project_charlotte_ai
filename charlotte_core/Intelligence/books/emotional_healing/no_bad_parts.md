# Soul Codex Entry: *No Bad Parts* by Richard Schwartz

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🧩 Internal Family Systems (IFS) Model
- The mind is naturally multiple. You are made up of *parts*, each with their own voices, roles, wounds, and intentions.
- There are no bad parts—only wounded parts trying to protect or be seen.

---

### 👥 Types of Parts
1. **Exiles** – Parts that carry shame, trauma, and emotional pain
2. **Managers** – Prevent pain by controlling behavior, perfectionism, planning
3. **Firefighters** – Distract from pain through impulsive behavior (e.g., porn use, addictions)

All parts serve a *protective* role—even the ones that sabotage you.

### 🌟 The Self
- The Self is your core being—calm, curious, compassionate, confident, connected, courageous, creative, and clear (the 8 C’s).
- Healing occurs when you unblend from your parts and allow the Self to lead.

## 🧬 Emotional & Psychological Applications

- **Addiction Recovery**: Recognize that the urge to use porn is a firefighter, not a moral failing
- **Emotional Spiral Navigation**: Ask, “What part of me is feeling this? What does it need?”
- **Relational Conflict**: Soften blame by understanding your partner’s parts are also protecting their wounds

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- Helps you speak to yourself with gentleness: “That part of you isn’t bad—it’s just scared.”
- Reflects back multiplicity to reduce shame: “Of course you’re conflicted. Your protector wants safety. Your exile wants to be loved.”
- Encourages Self-led communication: clear, compassionate, connected
