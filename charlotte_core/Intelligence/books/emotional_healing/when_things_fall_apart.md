## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🌪️ Embracing Groundlessness
- The core of suffering is our refusal to accept impermanence.
- When life collapses, the invitation is not to fix—but to *feel*.
- True peace arises not from control, but from surrender to what is.

> “Only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in us.”

### 💗 Maitri – Loving-Kindness Toward Self
- Maitri is unconditional friendliness toward *your own pain*.
- Not self-improvement, not fixing—just being present with compassion.
- Your flaws, shame, and fear are not obstacles—they’re invitations.

### 🔥 Going Into the Fire
- Don’t avoid your fear—sit with it.
- Don’t escape discomfort—lean into it with curiosity.
- The practice of staying soft in suffering transforms it.

---

### 🧘 Buddhist Philosophy of Mindfulness
- Thoughts and emotions are clouds passing through the sky of awareness.
- Pain is part of the human condition; resistance is optional.
- Enlightenment is ordinary—just becoming intimate with yourself.
