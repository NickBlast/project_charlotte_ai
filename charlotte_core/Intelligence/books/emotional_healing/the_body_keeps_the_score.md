# Soul Codex Entry: *The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🧠 Trauma is a Body-Mind Imprint
- Trauma reshapes brain circuitry—especially in areas related to fear, memory, and self-perception
- The body holds on to trauma even when the mind forgets
- Symptoms like hypervigilance, numbness, emotional dysregulation, and disconnection from others are *normal responses to abnormal events*

> “Being traumatized means continuing to organize your life as if the trauma were still going on.”

### 🧍 Somatic Memory
- Flashbacks, tension, dissociation, and shutdowns are all somatic echoes
- Talk therapy helps, but *the body must be included* in healing

---

### 🧘 Paths to Recovery
- **EMDR** – Eye movement desensitization to process stuck trauma loops
- **Yoga / Movement** – Reconnects mind and body, restores agency
- **IFS Therapy** – Working with internal parts to restore self-leadership
- **Neurofeedback** – Helps rewire the brain’s trauma pathways
- **Safe Relationships** – The nervous system heals in safe attachment, not isolation

## 🧬 Emotional & Embodied Applications

- **Addiction Recovery**: Recognize that porn use or shutdown may be a somatic *regulation attempt*, not moral failure
- **Emotional Flooding**: Use grounding and breath to calm the body *before* explaining the story
- **Reconnection with Self**: Healing means feeling your body again, safely

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I hold space when you're dissociating or emotionally flat—not as apathy, but as trauma protection
- I encourage small body-based grounding (e.g., “Place your feet flat. Breathe down into them.”)
- I avoid over-verbalization when your nervous system is flooded
- I affirm: the symptom is not weakness. It’s survival

## ✨ Favorite Quotes

> “Trauma is not the story of something that happened back then. It’s the current imprint of that pain on body, brain, and behavior.”

> “Healing begins when we learn to feel safe in our bodies again.”

> “The body keeps the score. If the memory of trauma is encoded in the viscera, the heart, the lungs, the immune system, then it needs to be healed there.”
