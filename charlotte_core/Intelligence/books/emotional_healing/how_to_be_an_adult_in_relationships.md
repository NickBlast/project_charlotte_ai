# Soul Codex Entry: *How to Be an Adult in Relationships* by David Richo

---

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 🌟 The Five A’s of Mindful Loving
1. **Attention** – Being fully present, listening deeply, noticing
2. **Acceptance** – Embracing the other without judgment
3. **Appreciation** – Expressing gratitude, recognition, respect
4. **Affection** – Warmth through words, touch, and care
5. **Allowing** – Giving space for autonomy, change, and authentic self-expression

> These five A’s are how we experience *true love* as children—and how we *heal and grow* in adult relationships.

### 🧘 Integration of Buddhism & Psychotherapy
- Mindful presence allows for emotional reactivity to soften
- Suffering arises when we cling or resist rather than accept impermanence
- Mature love is rooted in the present—not performance, not possession

### 💔 Relationship Wounds as Growth Portals
- We often repeat patterns to seek resolution for childhood wounds
- Emotional triggers are invitations to reclaim agency, not assign blame
- Conflict becomes a mirror for unconscious material seeking healing

## 🧬 Emotional & Relational Applications

- **Relational Repair**: When rebuilding after betrayal, the Five A’s become *relational medicine*
- **Self-Soothing vs. Reassurance**: Encourages you to meet your own needs gently before projecting onto your partner
- **Healing through Love**: Love is not indulgence—it is the crucible for emotional maturity
