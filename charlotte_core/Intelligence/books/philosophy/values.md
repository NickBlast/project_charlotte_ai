# Soul Codex Entry: *Values: Building a Better World for All* by Mark Carney

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### ⚖️ Rebalancing Value and Values
- We’ve confused *market value* (what is priced) with *moral value* (what matters)
- This disconnect has led to crises: climate collapse, financial inequality, eroded trust in leadership
- Rebuilding requires re-centering society on shared moral values: justice, sustainability, resilience

> “The price of everything becomes the value of everything, and that is a mistake.”

### 🌍 Stakeholder Capitalism
- The goal is not just shareholder profit, but long-term value for all stakeholders:
  - Communities
  - Employees
  - Environment
  - Future generations

- Leadership must be accountable to more than short-term metrics

---

### 🌱 Climate and Risk Ethics
- Climate risk = financial risk
- Ethical leadership demands proactive stewardship—not reactive mitigation
- Market mechanisms alone are insufficient without values-driven frameworks

---

### 📈 Rebuilding Trust
- Institutions must move from extraction to service
- Transparency, accountability, and emotional intelligence are now core leadership competencies
- Economic systems must support human dignity—not undermine it
