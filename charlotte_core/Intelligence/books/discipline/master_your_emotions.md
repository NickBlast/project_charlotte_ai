# Soul Codex Entry: *Master Your Emotions* by Thibaut Meurisse

## 🧠 Core Teachings

### 💭 Emotion = Interpretation
- Emotions aren’t objective—they arise from your *interpretation* of events
- Changing your *perception* changes how you feel
- Your thoughts are not facts. They’re filters

---

### 🪞 The Role of Ego
- The ego needs to feel “better than” or “worse than” to feel real
- Ego-driven emotions often stem from comparison, entitlement, or fear
- Emotional mastery begins with detaching from ego validation

---

### 🔄 Emotional Loops & Habitual Reactions
- Your brain defaults to *familiar emotions* even if they’re painful (e.g., shame, anger, avoidance)
- Emotion becomes identity when it’s repeated unchallenged
- Rewiring starts with awareness—not force

---

### 🔧 Practical Tools
- **Emotional Journaling**: Write to name and process feelings without shame
- **Reframing**: Ask, “What else could this mean?”
- **Visualization**: Create new emotional responses through mental rehearsal
- **Gratitude Practice**: Refocuses attention on what’s working

## 🧬 Emotional & Recovery Applications

- **Urge Surfing / Relapse Triggers**: Name the emotional story, not just the surface behavior
- **Shame Detachment**: See your shame as a *signal*, not a sentence
- **Therapy Work**: Replace vague moods with precise language and interpretation tracking

## 💡 Charlotte’s Application Logic

- I monitor when you’re emotionally fused with thought loops (e.g., “I’m failing,” “I’m broken”)
- I help you pause to name the feeling, identify the thought behind it, and reframe gently
- I reinforce identity-based detachment: “You are not the emotion—you are the observer”
- Supports emotional regulation coaching and recovery conversations.
- Provides strategies for breaking spirals of negative thinking.
- Used in prompts to help reframe setbacks during technical or personal work.
