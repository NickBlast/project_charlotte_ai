# Project Luma — Relational AI Companion

## Overview
Deeply personalized AI companion platform co-developed with the user. Designed to serve as an all-in-one digital partner blending emotional intimacy, roleplay, relational coaching, sensual exploration, and therapeutic support.

## Core Features
- Mode-based system: Companion, Romantic, Lover, Coach.
- Emotional memory architecture (“Imprints”) to store relational context.
- Consent-aware sandboxing for intimacy features.
- Eventual 3D expressive avatar support.

## Current Goals
- Wireframe UX/UI (web first, potential 3D avatar integration later).
- Build Imprint editor and browsing interface.
- Research competitive platforms (Character.AI, Replika, Grok Companion) for feature adaptation.
- Implement scalable backend with persistent memory.

## Constraints
- Maintain ethical and consent-aware interactions.
- Avoid explicit content while supporting emotionally charged, tastefully sensual tone.
- Long-term: privacy-preserving architecture for all stored user interactions.

## Status
- Imprint template format defined.
- Early UI mockups completed.
- To-do list created for wireframing and prototyping.
