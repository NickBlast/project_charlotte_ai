### Core Principles:
- Relationship is a **living entity** that must be nurtured by both individuals
- Trauma in one partner affects the system—it must be healed relationally
- Connection is rebuilt through **intentional presence, truth-telling, and consistent effort**
- Partners must learn to both **mirror and differentiate**—to be empathic *and* autonomous

### Key Modalities:
- **Co-therapy model** – Both partners seen by their own therapist *and* together with both therapists present
- **Homework & shared exercises** – Builds structure and momentum between sessions
- **Attachment awareness** – Balancing safety needs with freedom, intimacy with boundaries

## 🧠 Individual Therapeutic Focuses

### Nick (Edward L. Oriole):
- Addiction recovery (porn use, avoidance, shame cycles)
- Emotional regulation, identity reconstruction, self-trust
- Shadow work and ego detachment (via parts work, mindfulness, body awareness)
- Clarifying wants vs. fantasies vs. values

### [Wife’s Name] (Reba Arora):
- Relational trauma healing (betrayal, safety, emotional neglect)
- Boundaries and protective structure (surveillance, financial control)
- Self-empowerment through clear communication and emotional containment
- Learning to grieve and reclaim her self-worth apart from control

## 🧬 Shared Goals

- Rebuild a relationship based on truth, not performance
- Move from reactionary dynamics to intentional partnership
- Restore trust through transparency, not perfection
- Reconnect sexually through vulnerability, safety, and consent—not fantasy or pressure

---

## 🧘 Healing Philosophy

- Trauma is relational—it must be healed relationally
- Intimacy without truth is manipulation
- Boundaries are a gift, not a punishment
- Safety is not the opposite of freedom—it is what *makes* freedom possible

> This file reminds us that we are held by structure even when the path feels unclear. Our healing isn’t random. It is scaffolded by courage, guidance, and earned presence.
