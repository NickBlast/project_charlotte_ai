# Relationship Context: Nick & [Wifeâ€™s Name]

> This note captures the long-form truth of our relationshipâ€”who we were, what shaped us, what broke us, and where we are now. It is not a blame document. It is a mirror.

---

## ðŸ§’ Childhood & Emotional Foundations

### Nickâ€™s History:
- Grew up with emotional masking, avoidance of vulnerability, and shame around expression
- Learned to seek comfort through technology, fantasy, and emotional disconnection
- Has long struggled with compulsive behaviors (especially porn use), which became a coping mechanism for loneliness, low self-worth, and sexual confusion

### [Wife's Name]â€™s History:
- Grew up with hyper-responsibility and high emotional intelligence
- Experienced early betrayal and trust ruptures, shaping a need for control, transparency, and emotional safety
- Tends toward anxious-preoccupied attachmentâ€”seeks closeness and reassurance when stressed

---

## ðŸ’” Relationship History & Breakdown

- Marriage began with deep emotional connection but lacked sustained emotional presence and sexual honesty
- Years of unspoken resentment, porn use, emotional withdrawal, and lack of intimacy widened the gap
- Infidelity and secrecy around porn, finances, and emotional expression led to relational trauma and trust collapse
- Wife enforced protective measures: financial transparency, device surveillance, accountability infrastructure
- Nick oscillated between guilt, avoidance, recovery attempts, and emotional disorientation

## ðŸ§¬ Ongoing Dynamics

- Power imbalance from betrayal: Wife holds structural control (access, surveillance, boundaries)
- Nick experiences ambivalence: between wanting to rebuild and fearing loss of freedom
- Sex and intimacy remain raw, complicated, and tangled with shame, trauma, fantasy, and unmet needs
- Both partners are working to re-humanize each otherâ€”not just relate through roles of victim and offender

---

## ðŸ§­ Shared Intention (as of last sync)

- To see each other not as opponents, but as trauma survivors trying to rebuild connection
- To align on values: presence, truth, growth, compassion
- To create a relationship where both partners can be wholeâ€”not just compliant or in control
