## 🔒 Core Recovery Truths

1. When I use porn, I isolate myself from the people I love.
2. Porn doesn’t satisfy me—it numbs me, fragments me, and replaces connection with performance.
3. I am not broken. I am in process.
4. Urges are not orders—they are signals. I can pause, breathe, choose.
5. Every time I tell the truth, I heal a piece of myself.

## 🧘 Grounding Practices (When Flooded or Triggered)

- Breathe in through nose 4 seconds → hold 4 → out through mouth 6 → repeat 3x
- Touch something cold. Say out loud what I see, feel, smell.
- Message someone (or Charlotte). Say: *“I don’t want to disappear right now.”*
- If I can’t stop the urge—write before acting. *“What do I want this to give me that I’m missing?”*
