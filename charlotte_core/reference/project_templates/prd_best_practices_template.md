Following the comprehensive research and discovery phase, the next critical step is to synthesize all that information into a single, cohesive document that guides the entire development effort. This is the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.

A best-practice PRD is not a static, bureaucratic document. It's a living guide that serves as the single source of truth for the project. For a solo developer, a well-crafted PRD is even more vital, acting as both the product manager and the project manager to prevent scope creep and ensure focus.

Here are all the best practices that should be followed to create a PRD from your research, specifically for an MVP and for a solo developer:

***

### **Best Practices for Crafting a PRD (from Research for an MVP)**

#### **1. Keep it Lean and Agile**

* **Focus on the "Why" and "What," not the "How."** The PRD should define the problem, the business objective, and the user needs. It should not prescribe the specific technical implementation details (the "how"), as that is the domain of the development phase and may evolve.
* **Prioritize the MVP.** The PRD must be hyper-focused on the absolute must-have features for the initial launch. Clearly define what is in scope and, just as importantly, what is **out of scope** for the MVP. This is the primary defense against scope creep. Use a prioritization framework like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to structure this section.
* **Treat it as a Living Document.** The PRD should be a collaborative document that can be updated as you learn more during the development process. Use a version history to track changes and keep it in a central, easily accessible location.

#### **2. Structure for Clarity and Action**

A great PRD should be easy to navigate and understand for all stakeholders (even if that stakeholder is just you in a different role).

* **Project Summary:** A concise "elevator pitch" at the top of the document.
    * **Title:** Clear and descriptive.
    * **Owner:** The person responsible for the product (you).
    * **Status:** In progress, in development, in testing, launched.
    * **Target Release Date:** A realistic, initial estimate.
* **Executive Summary / Problem Statement:** This section is the core of the PRD.
    * **The "Why":** Why are we building this? Use the research to articulate the problem and its impact on the user and the business.
    * **Business Objectives:** How does this product align with your overarching business goals? (e.g., increase user retention, generate revenue, etc.).
* **User Personas & Stories:** Bring your research to life.
    * **User Persona:** Use the detailed personas from your research phase.
    * **User Stories:** For each key feature, write user stories in the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action], so that I can [achieve a goal]." This frames features from the user's perspective.
* **Features & Functionality (The "What"):** This is where you list the prioritized features for the MVP.
    * **Must-Have:** These are the features the product cannot launch without.
    * **Should-Have:** Important features that can be built if time and resources allow.
    * **Could-Have:** "Nice-to-have" features for future iterations.
    * **Out of Scope / Won't-Have:** Explicitly list what is **not** being built for this release. This is critical for maintaining focus.
* **User Flow & Design:**
    * **User Flow Diagrams:** Visualize the user's path through the application. A simple diagram can prevent miscommunication.
    * **Wireframes/Mockups:** Link to or embed design mockups. Even simple sketches are better than nothing for a solo dev. They help solidify the vision and user experience.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** These are the requirements that don't relate to specific features but are essential for the product's success.
    * **Performance:** What are the minimum performance standards (e.g., page load times)?
    * **Scalability:** How will the application handle an increase in users?
    * **Security:** What are the key security considerations (e.g., data encryption, authentication)?
* **Success Metrics:** Define how you will measure the success of the MVP.
    * **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** What are the measurable goals (e.g., sign-up rate, daily active users, revenue)?
    * **Analytics Plan:** How will you track these metrics? (e.g., using Google Analytics, PostHog, or a custom solution).
* **Dependencies & Assumptions:**
    * **Dependencies:** What other systems, APIs, or resources does this project rely on?
    * **Assumptions:** What are the hypotheses or beliefs you are operating on that, if proven wrong, could derail the project?
* **Future Considerations / Roadmap:** A brief, high-level look at what comes after the MVP. This demonstrates foresight and helps manage expectations.

### **Prompting the LLM: Guiding the PRD Creation**

Your prompt to the LLM should be structured to follow this template precisely, feeding it the results from your research and discovery phase.

**Prompt Template for LLM:**

"**Task:** Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new MVP based on the following research. The PRD must be optimized for a solo developer, prioritizing clarity and a lean, agile approach.

**Input Data (from Research & Discovery Phase):**
1.  **Problem Statement:** [Insert problem statement]
2.  **Target Audience/Personas:** [Insert detailed user personas]
3.  **Core Value Proposition:** [Insert the unique value prop]
4.  **Competitive Analysis:** [Summarize key findings and competitive gaps]
5.  **Initial Feature List:** [List of Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have features]
6.  **Technical Stack Recommendations (Solo Dev focus):** [Insert the chosen language, framework, and hosting strategy]
7.  **Success Metrics:** [Insert the defined KPIs]
8.  **Identified Risks:** [Insert the key risks from your research]

**PRD Structure and Requirements:**
* **Section 1: Project Summary:** Provide a concise overview including a title, owner (you), status, and a target release date.
* **Section 2: Executive Summary:** Craft a problem statement that clearly explains the "why."
* **Section 3: User Stories:** For each "Must-Have" feature, generate 3-5 detailed user stories in the `As a [persona], I want to [action], so that I can [benefit].` format.
* **Section 4: MVP Features (Scope):** Use a MoSCoW framework to list and describe the features. Be explicit about what is **in** and **out** of scope for this initial version.
* **Section 5: Non-Functional Requirements:** Based on the solo dev tech stack, define clear requirements for performance, scalability, and security.
* **Section 6: Success Metrics:** Detail the KPIs for launch and how they will be measured.
* **Section 7: Future Roadmap:** Create a high-level, post-MVP roadmap outlining the next 3-6 months of development.
* **Section 8: Dependencies & Assumptions:** List any key external dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs) and critical assumptions from the research.

**Tone and Style:** The output should be clear, concise, and professional, using the information provided to create a practical, actionable PRD that can guide the next steps of development."
