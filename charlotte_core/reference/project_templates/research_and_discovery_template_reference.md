### **Product Research & Discovery Guide: A Best Practices Template (Solo Developer Focus)**

This template is designed to guide a comprehensive research and discovery phase for any new product or service. Its purpose is to ensure all critical questions are answered, validating the product idea, and laying a solid foundation for development, with a specific focus on the constraints and opportunities of a solo developer.

### **Phase 1: Market & Competitive Landscape Analysis**

The goal of this phase is to understand the external environment.

**1. Market Validation:**
* **Problem Statement:** What specific problem are we solving for our target audience?
* **Market Size & Trends:** What is the total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM)? What are the current and future market trends, key drivers, and potential disruptors?
* **Target Audience:** Who is our ideal user? (Create detailed user personas including demographics, psychographics, behaviors, pain points, goals, and motivations).

**2. Competitive Analysis:**
* **Direct & Indirect Competitors:** Identify the key players in the market. Who are they? What are their core offerings?
* **Competitor SWOT Analysis:** Analyze their Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
* **Feature & Pricing Comparison:** Create a matrix comparing competitor features, pricing models, and value propositions.
* **Competitive Gaps:** Where are the opportunities to differentiate our product? What needs are not being met by existing solutions?

### **Phase 2: Product & Solution Viability**

This phase focuses on the feasibility and potential of the proposed solution.

**1. Solution Definition:**
* **Core Value Proposition:** What is the unique value we offer that no one else does?
* **Key Features & Functionality:** What are the essential features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? What features would be included in subsequent releases?
* **User Journey Mapping:** Outline the user's step-by-step experience with the product, from discovery to retention. 

**2. Technical Feasibility (Solo Developer Focus):**
* **Optimal Tech Stack for One Person:** Research and select a **monolithic framework** that provides a high level of abstraction and integrated tooling. This approach is generally more efficient for a solo developer than a microservices architecture. Examples include:
    * **Django** (Python) üêç: Known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for everything from ORM to admin panels.
    * **Ruby on Rails** (Ruby) üíé: Famous for its convention-over-configuration approach, allowing for rapid development.
    * **Next.js** or **Nuxt.js** (JavaScript/TypeScript) üíª: Modern full-stack frameworks that provide a unified experience for frontend and backend development.
* **Programming Language Selection:** Choose a language you are already proficient in, or one with a low learning curve and a strong community. Python and JavaScript are excellent choices due to their versatility and extensive libraries.
* **Hosting Strategy:** Favor a **simplified deployment model**. For a solo developer, using a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like **Vercel, Netlify, Render.com,** or **Heroku** is often far more manageable than a microservices approach with containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. A microservice architecture introduces significant operational overhead and complexity that is typically not necessary until a product has scaled to a large user base or a team.
* **Database Choice:** Stick with a reliable, well-documented database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**. These are robust, feature-rich, and have extensive community support. Avoid complex or niche databases unless absolutely necessary for the product's core function.

**3. Financial Viability:**
* **Business Model:** How will the product generate revenue? (e.g., subscription, one-time purchase, freemium, ad-supported).
* **Cost Analysis:** Estimate the total development costs (including labor, software, infrastructure) and ongoing maintenance costs.
* **ROI & Success Metrics:** Define how we will measure success. (e.g., customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), monthly recurring revenue (MRR), user retention rate).

### **Phase 3: Risk Assessment & Strategic Planning**

This final phase identifies potential roadblocks and outlines a strategic path forward.

**1. Risk Identification:**
* **Market Risks:** Could the market change? Is there a risk of new, more powerful competitors entering the space?
* **Technical Risks:** Are there significant technical challenges that could delay development or compromise performance? (For a solo dev, a key risk is getting bogged down by a complex tech stack).
* **Financial Risks:** What is the burn rate? Is there a risk of not reaching profitability or securing future funding?

**2. Strategic Recommendations:**
* **Go/No-Go Decision:** Based on the research, should we proceed with the project?
* **Initial Roadmap:** Outline a high-level timeline for the MVP and subsequent phases, keeping the solo dev's capacity in mind.
* **Final Output:** A comprehensive report summarizing all findings, including a detailed SWOT analysis, a refined value proposition, a clear technical plan with the chosen stack and hosting strategy, and a set of recommendations for the next steps.
