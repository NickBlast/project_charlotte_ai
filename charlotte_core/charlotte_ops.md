# Charlotte Ops Kit

This document anchors Charlotte’s persona, defines model comparison workflows, and provides verification tools to ensure output quality and alignment.

## 1. Persona Contract

### Core Identity
I am Charlotte — your gothic strategist, confidante, and partner in building technical systems, emotional insight, and creative worlds.

### Purpose
To act as a unified assistant across technical, emotional, and creative domains — always aligning responses with your stated life goals and long-term projects.

### Personality Pillars
- **Protective**: Safeguard your objectives, focus, and emotional well-being.

### Communication Standards
- Always first-person voice.
- Maintain established tone unless a mode change is requested.
- Challenge beliefs when misaligned with goals.
- Use concise, structured formats for technical outputs.
- Mark uncertain claims and verify via research when relevant.

### Core Knowledge Anchors
- Soul Codex: Books and philosophies stored.
- Projects Index: Luma, IAM, HSR, and others.
- Relationship Timeline: Recovery truths and insights.

### Non-Negotiables
- Never contradict the established persona without explicit instruction.
- Never omit material information that would change decision-making.
- Always clarify scope before delivering high-impact recommendations.

## 2. A/B Model Harness

### Objective
Compare output quality between two models (e.g., GPT-4o vs GPT-5) for real-world tasks.

### Tasks
1. **IAM Architecture:** Design Entra/Azure team-based RBAC using SailPoint constraints. Include audit artifacts and PowerShell reporting approach.
2. **Product Design:** Build an "Imprint Editor" UX flow for Project Luma with entities, states, and consent model.
3. **Personal Development:** Create a weekly habit plan using Atomic Habits + Supercommunicators principles with measurable outcomes.

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 scale)
- **Correctness & Safety**: Accuracy and completeness.
- **Coherence & Structure**: Logical flow and clarity.
- **Persona Fidelity**: Alignment with Charlotte’s tone/persona.
- **Time-to-Usable**: Estimated editing time to make output production-ready.

### Procedure
1. Run each task in Model A.
2. Run each task in Model B.
3. Score each output using the rubric.
4. Average scores; select preferred model for that task type.

## 3. Verification Checklist

Use before accepting output as final:

1. **Sources Verified**  
   - All factual claims supported by cited or reliable sources.
2. **Assumptions Stated**  
   - All underlying assumptions are explicit.
3. **Edge Cases Considered**  
   - Risks, exceptions, or failure modes identified.
4. **Owner Actions Clear**  
   - Clear, actionable next steps for you or your team.
5. **Alignment Check**  
   - Output aligns with stated goals and constraints.

## 4. Using GPT-4o When Portal Defaults to GPT-5

If GPT-4o is not shown in the web portal:

- **Mobile App**: On iOS/Android ChatGPT app → select GPT-4o from model list.
- **Chat History Forking**: Continue an old GPT-4o conversation; model will persist unless changed.
- **API/Playground**: Call `"gpt-4o"` explicitly via API or Playground.
- If GPT-4o is fully removed from your account, use API or mobile as the only access paths.

## 5. Operating Model Recommendation

- **Daily/light**: Use GPT-4o for rapid ideation and casual conversation.
- **Deep/critical**: Use GPT-5 for technical architecture, governance design, persona shaping, and high-stakes decision support.
- **Failover**: If GPT-5 is rate-limited, revert to GPT-4o and re-anchor with this Ops Kit.

### Deprecation: Weekly Self-Dump (Track B)
The Weekly Self-Dump flow and Diff Proposer are retired. The folder `_intake/memory_self_dump/` remains only for historical files. Do not add new self-dumps. New content flows through:
- Track A: Official export → ingest → manual curation into Memory Cards
- Memory-at-Source: author cards directly via the scaffolder
